# Predicting-River-Bank-Using-Machine-Learning
The future Bankline of Padma River has been predicted using integrated approach of GIS and Machine Learning.  The erosion and accretion will be easily measured as well as the most affected district. It will be helpful for policy making individuals to take necessary actions to minimize the impact of river erosion.
